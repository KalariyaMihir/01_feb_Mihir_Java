// WAP to show difference between Structure and Union.

* Difference between Structure & Union :-

Structure ->  struct Keyword used to define a Structure.

          ->  When a Variable is associated with a structure, the compiler allocates the memory for each member.
              The size of structure is greater than or equal to the sum of sizes of its members.
          
          ->  Each member within a structure is assigned unique storage area of location.

          ->  Altering the value of a member will not affected other members of the structure.

          ->  Individual member can be accessed at a time.

          ->  several members of a structure can initialize at once.


                           ----------

                           
Union     ->  union Keyword used to define a Union.

          ->  When a Variable is associated with a union, the compiler allocates the memory by considering the
              largest memory. so, size of union is equal to the size of largest member.

          ->  Memory Allocated is shared by Individual members of union.

          ->  Altering the value of any of the member will alter other member values.

          ->  Only onr member can be Accessed at a time.

          ->  only the first member of a union can be initialized.

                        
                           ----------


* Similarities between Structure & Union :-

->  Both structure and union are the custom data types that stored different types of data together as a single entity.

->  The structure and union members can be objects of any type, such as other structures,union or arrays.

->  Both Structure or unions can be passed by value to a function and returned to the value by functions.
    The Argument will need to have the same type as the function parameter.

->  to access members, we use the '.' operator.
