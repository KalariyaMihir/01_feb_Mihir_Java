   - There are 4 types of normalization or 4 types to sort the data.
	1.) FNF  : First Normal Form 
	2.) SNF  : Second Normal Form 
	3.) TNF  : Third Normal Form 
	4.) BCNF : Boyce and Code Normal Form

3) What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS ?

-> DBMS :- DBMS stands for Database Management System. it used to Sort Data 
-> RDBMs :- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System .it used to sort realtional data in database.

8) What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints ?

-> - Constraints key used to put Different types of rules in data or table.
   - There are Three Types of keys : 1.) Primary Key
						 2.) Unique Key
						 3.) Foreign Key 

	1.) Primary key : - Primary key is column of tbale which uniquely identifies each rows.
				- We can use primary key once in table.
				- Primary key doesn't accept same value or null value.
				- To give Auto_increment or foreign key Primary key is compulsory.
				- QUERY : Alter table `tablename` add Primary keys (`column name`);

	2.) Unique Key  : - Unique Key constraints also identifies uniquely in table.
				- we can use unique Multiple time.
				- Unique key doesn't accept same value but accept 1 null value.
				- QUERY : Alter Table `tablename` add Unique keys (`column name`);

	3.) Foreign key : - Foreign key used to give reference from one table to another table. 
				- one tables primeery key field is added to a related many tables in order to create the common field which reletes the two table,
				  it is called a foregin key in the many table.
				- QUERY : Alter Table `tablename2` add Foreign key (`Columnname2`) references `reference table name` (`column name`);
