What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart :


-> DFD known as a DATA FLOW DIAGRAM

-> A DFD maps out the flow of information for any process or system.

-> It uses defined  symbols like rectangles, circles, and arrows, plus short text labels, to show data inputs, outputs , storage points and the routs between each destination.

-> They can be used to analyze an existing system or model a new one.

-> There are 4 main Symbols in Data Flow Diagram :

        1. Entity
        2. process
        3. Data store 
        4. Data Flow 

-> Rules of DFD : 

        * Each process should have at least one input and an output.
        * Each data store should have at least one data flow in and one data flow out.
        * Data stored in a system must go through a process.
        * All Processes in a DFD go to another Process or a data store.
